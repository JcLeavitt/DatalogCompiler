# DatalogCompiler
Datalog Compiler &amp; Interpreter comprised of a parser, lexical analyzer, and relational database

FinishedCompiler-Interpreter.zip contains the final version of the project. If you are using Linux/Unix/WSL you can use the runtests.txt file which will compile, link, build, and then run all of the tests with the ex4#.txt files as the input and pipe the output to the corresponding testoutput-ex4#.txt

This should also work with the normal windows Cmd prompt with MINGW, however I have not experimented with that myself.
